## Privacy Policy
Universal Remote Control (URC) operates as an Amazon Alexa Skill created by Stefan Reisner. It is URC’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating.

We use your Personal Information only to provide a personalized user experience. By enabling the skill, you agree to use of information in accordance with this policy.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

During account linking the skill will access your e-mail address. This address will be stored in the system for the purpose of account linking. This information will not be shared with third parties. We will not send you any e-mails. We endeavour to make sure this information is stored securely and destroyed when requested from Alexa module.

The Google Account you provide will be linked in order to access a Google Spreadsheet named "UniversalRemoteControlData" that you have to create in your account's My Drive.

**Information We Collect from Other Sources**

We do not collect any data from other sources.

**Data Retention Policy**

The skill stores a connection ID in AWS Dynamo DB. This ID is required to communicate with the ESP8266 device via the AWS API Gateway.
This connection ID is stored until the skill tries to use it the first time after it has become invalid (because the ESP8266 device has been turned off or has re-connected).
Such stale connection IDs are deleted from the database.

**Log Data**

To be able to investigate issues with the skill, the Receipts List skill stores logs with Amazon CloudWatch. These logs may included personally-identifying information as well, which are not exposed, sold or used besides the tracking of issues.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

Stefan Reisner discloses any potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of his employees or co-workers, that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Stefan Reisner’s behalf, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees may be located outside of your home country; by using Receipts List skill, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Stefan Reisner will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to his employees, as described above, Stefan Reisner discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Stefan Reisner believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Stefan Reisner, third parties or the public at large. Stefan Reisner takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

**Privacy Policy Changes**

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Stefan Reisner may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in his sole discretion. He encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this skill after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
